# ActiveDirectory-WindowsServer22Demo
Demo setup of an Active Directory using PowerShell on a Windows Server 2022 VM in Oracle VirtualBox.

This project will provide a fully automated demo environment for setting up Active Directory on a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine using Windows PowerShell scripts inside the Oracle VirtualBox. Ideal for learning, testing, and showcasing AD setup and management.

Here are the steps I did to build Active Directory Demo HomeLab.

**Step 1: Create a virtual machine by clicking on "New" in VirtualBox, naming it "WinServer2022AD" and selecting "Windows 10 (64 bit)" as boot media. **
